Concepts:
- There are three areas in git 
	- workspace
	- staging area
	- local repository
	- remote repository
- We always move the files between workspace->staging->local->remote
- workspace to staging is moved by 'git add' command
- staging to local repository moved by 'git commit -m "commit message"' command
- local to remote repo is moved by git push

- remote to local repository is moved by git pull/git fetch



Different Commands

1. git init
=> git init command initialises the existing local repository

2. git commit
=> git commit, saves your changes to local repository(if done on local system)
